which queues they play
position preference for that queues
tier, rank, points:
    match-making
    players better / worse than you (used to find out which lane opponent has gone on to do better or worse than you, to find out which team-mates have gone off to do better or worse than you)
    how do you stack up against other players in this "rank, tier"
wins / losses:
    your win loss rate
    analyse the games you won and loss to find out what is done right or wrong
hotStreak, freshBlood, veteran, inactive, miniseries, win/loss:
    hotStreak with freshBlood can be used to see if you are climbing
    can be used to find out if you are hardstuck with veteran
    inactive - can be used to see often you play lol and advise you to play normal as many things have changed (use LastUpdated from summoner info if it's present)
    miniseries - can be used?

leagueId can be used to compare you against the summoners in your league
